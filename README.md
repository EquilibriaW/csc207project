## Project Plan, Description & Example API Usage
The problem domain we want to focus on is communication. 
More specifically, we are thinking of developing a real-time desktop messaging app with additional support for sending photos and interacting with chatbots.

We are considering using Firebase Cloud Database to store our messages in the cloud. 
Firebase Cloud Database is scalable, reliable, and has a good RESTful interface.
Here is the Firebase Cloud Database API documentation: https://firebase.google.com/docs/database. 

Below is an image of us trying it out in postman below:

We have not faced any technical problems so far. The following are some of our runner up project ideas:
- A messaging app
- Cryptocurrency wallet
- 2FA helper app
- Malware
- VPN
